                                <h5>What training have you had?<br></h5>
                                <p>Currently, I am working on my doula certification at DONA international. DONA (doulas of North America) is well known and provides teaching and hands on training and experience. In the past, I have attended several births at homes and at hospitals. I have even had the opportunity to deliver!<br></p>

                                <p>I usually meet my clients (depending on if this is your first and how you feel) anywhere from 34-36 weeks. The "where" is someplace that serves decaf coffee, a smoothie, or tea. It's always my treat during our first meeting!<br>Feel free to text me day or night. 24/7. As far as calling, only call if you are having an emergency (or in labor) and have called your care provider FIRST. I am informed, but can not replace a doctor, OB, or midwife.<br>I would love to meet you after you take baby home as soon as 24 hours afterward. I will have a typed up evaluation of your delivery so we can discuss what went well and what you feel could have gone better. I may even have a gift for you, baby or your partner! We all did this together!</p>

                                <p>Once we have mutually agreed to work together, I will ask for half of the whole fee upfront, and the 2nd half a week after your delivery.</p>

                                <h5>What is your philosophy about birth about supporting women and their partners through labor?</h5>
                                <p>I believe that women are strong and capable of having children with the loving support of having the right people around her. Although, statistically women who received continuous support were more likely to have spontaneous vaginal births and less likely to have any pain medication, I will never doubt your own intuition on what you believe your body can and can not do. I always give you informed, well thought through questions for you to ask your health care provider. I will NOT judge or stop you from receiving an epidural or any medical decisions your health care provider makes for the health of you and your baby.<br></p>

                                <p>This will entirely depend on you. Please call your care provider and then me (in that order) I will need to know how mom is feeling, if there has been evidence showing labor, and how strong and close contractions are.<br></p>
