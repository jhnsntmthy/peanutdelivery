                            <h2>My story: why I chose to become a bereavement doula</h2>
                            <p>I realize through life that people assume a lot about one another. But no one knows what happens behind closed doors, and how tears are cried and, the challenges we face. For me, that challenge looked like two pink lines. I had had three children throughout my twenties, and my hands were full. I became pregnant again and carried my daughter for 21 weeks before she passed away. It was a freak umbilical cord accident. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t my fault. It just... happened. And the months following were well meaning people giving their condolences in the ways they knew best. Projecting their stories of grief… telling me I could try again soon. I carried around the guilt and shame of saying I even birthed another baby, by seeing the looks on others faces when I would bring it up. But the thing about life is that it needs to be validated. No matter for how long that life is.  So, somehow I pulled myself together and kept living. 
                            </p>
                            <p>A few years later I had a surprise pregnancy (this time a boy) and had a uneventful, wonderful pregnancy. It was a beautiful birth. Full of hope and gratefulness. When he was two, I became pregnant again.  At 21 weeks, another baby daughter passed. This time with NO reason. This time in my life, I had no one to lean on. I had moved away, a church family had split and I had four children and a heartbroken husband. I cried out to God “I can not do this again. I can not go through this again.” But I was forced. I gave birth and she was here. We said hello and goodbye in the same day. In the months that followed I was physically and emotionally broken. There was no escape from grief.
                            </p>
                            </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-6 mt--3"> 
                            <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
                            <p>I slowly realized that I had to become someone else. 
                                I had to become someone that was stronger than my circumstances. 
                                I had to make a conscious choice to come back to life. For my family, 
                                for my sanity and, for a chance to live differently. I read somewhere 
                                that grief is love that has nowhere to go. I had to let that love go 
                                somewhere. I became a  certified bereavement doula (a birth coach who helps 
                                facilitate emotional and physical loss to bereaved mothers),  
                                There’s too many times women lose pregnancies and carry around guilt and shame. 
                                They say “Well, I wasn’t pregnant that long.”  They brush off the feelings 
                                like it was just a missed opportunity, not a big deal. They can’t say the 
                                name of their child in fear it would make someone uncomfortable. I want to 
                                tell YOU sweet mama, “This will always be your child. You will always be 
                                their mother. You don’t need to get over this. This child will change you 
                                into the person you need to become.” My passed children changed me into 
                                someone who allows others to have  the space  they need to feel what they 
                                are feeling. Without shame or condemnation. I am here to bring you comfort 
                                and say “I’m here and it’s OK.”
                                </p>
                            <p>
